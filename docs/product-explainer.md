# Jaanch: paste it, Jaanch investigates it

**Jaanch** (जाँच, "inspection") checks the claims in an investment message against India's
official records before you send money.

## The problem

Retail investors receive investment pitches on WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS and social media. The
convincing ones borrow credibility:

- a **real SEBI registration number** that belongs to someone else;
- "SEBI approved" tips, "NSE partner" apps;
- **guaranteed** daily or monthly returns;
- "institutional accounts", "FPI accounts", "sure-shot IPO allotment";
- payment to a personal UPI ID, an app to install from a link, a deadline of "today only".

The investor's real question is simple: _"Before I pay, are the claims in this message backed by
evidence?"_ Checking that today means knowing which SEBI register to search, how registration
numbers work, what SEBI's rules say about returns and payments. All of it in English, on a website.

## What Jaanch does

Paste the message, upload screenshots of the chat, add a link or record a voice note on the Jaanch
website. Usually within a minute, Jaanch returns a report:

- **Every claim, one by one**, with a stamp: **CONTRADICTED**, **MATCHES**, **NOT FOUND** or
  **CAN'T CHECK**.
- **The evidence** behind each one: the SEBI register entry (name, number, validity, official
  email/phone, address), the SEBI rule with its circular and clause, the RBI Alert List entry, the
  domain's registration date. Each comes with a link to the official page and an "as of" date.
- **Who is contacting you vs who is registered**: a side-by-side table of the message's name,
  number, phone, email and website against the official record.
- **Warning signs**: pressure tactics, OTP requests, APK links, look-alike websites, personal UPI
  IDs, accuracy claims. Each is explained in plain words.
- **What could not be checked**: always listed, because no problem found is not proof of safety.
- **What to do next**: confirm through the official contact on SEBI's record (not the numbers in
  the message), check the UPI ID on SEBI Check, report the message on Sanchar Saathi (Chakshu).
- **"I already paid"**: 1930, cybercrime.gov.in, your bank, a UPI fraud complaint, what to keep,
  and a copyable evidence summary for your complaint. Jaanch never asks for your bank details.

Everything is available in **English and Hindi**.

## The differentiator: "The registration number is real. It just isn't theirs."

Most scam checks ask whether a number is valid. Jaanch asks whether **the party contacting you
is the party the number belongs to**.

> _Message (fictional sender):_ "Sharma Investments / SEBI Registered Research Analyst / Reg No:
> INH000011431 / 🔥 Guaranteed 30% monthly returns in F&O 🔥 / Pay ₹4,999 joining fee to UPI:
> 9876501234@ybl"
>
> **CONTRADICTED**: The message says INH000011431 belongs to Sharma Investments. SEBI's register
> shows INH000011431 is registered to 360 ONE Distribution Services Limited (Mumbai), a different
> name.
>
> **NOT FOUND**: We found no SEBI-registered intermediary named Sharma Investments (register
> updated 3 Oct 2026).
>
> **CONTRADICTED**: The message claims SEBI registration (Research Analyst) and also promises
> guaranteed returns. SEBI's rules do not allow registered advisers, analysts or brokers to promise
> assured returns. _(SEBI Master Circular for Research Analysts, 6 Feb 2026, para 11.1(c)(x))_
>
> **CONTRADICTED**: The message asks for payment to 9876501234@ybl for a SEBI-registered service
> (Research Analyst). SEBI requires registered intermediaries to collect UPI payments through
> validated UPI IDs ending in "@valid…", and their old UPI IDs were to be discontinued.
> 9876501234@ybl is not such an ID. _(SEBI circular SEBI/HO/DEPA-II/DEPA-II_SRG/P/CIR/2025/86,
> 11 Jun 2025)_

This is live output on 4 Oct 2026: the AI model read the demo screenshot and the engine checked it
against SEBI's register (about 30 seconds end to end). The registered firm has nothing to do with the message;
its number was borrowed. Jaanch reports exactly that: what the record shows, without accusing
anyone.

## What Jaanch is not

- Not investment advice; it never says buy, sell, hold or invest.
- Not a "safe/scam" score; there is no overall rating.
- Not a judgement about any person or firm; it reports what official records show.
- Not a chatbot; it investigates the claims in what you send.

## How it decides

```
LLM READS  →  TOOLS VERIFY  →  CODE ADJUDICATES  →  LLM EXPLAINS
```

An AI model reads the screenshot and lists the claims word for word. Jaanch then looks them up in
SEBI's registers, RBI's Alert List, domain records and a table of SEBI rules, and fixed rules
(not the AI) decide each verdict. Explanations come from reviewed templates in English and Hindi.
If anything was unclear in the screenshot, Jaanch says it can't check rather than guessing.

## Built for Bharat

- **Works from the phone**: a light website, no app to install; take a screenshot of the
  WhatsApp or Telegram chat and upload it.
- **Hindi and English**, including Hinglish and Devanagari screenshots; one tap switches language.
- **Voice notes** (speech-to-text) when supported by the configured provider.
- **Light on data**: screenshots are compressed in the browser before upload; installable as an
  app, and on Android other apps can share text or links straight to Jaanch.
- **Plain language**: no jargon, short sentences, large tap targets.

## Privacy in one paragraph

Screenshots and voice notes are deleted as soon as they are read. Reports are kept for 7 days so
the link works, then deleted, or deleted immediately with the "Delete this report" button. No account,
no phone number, and IP addresses are never stored. In this prototype, an NVIDIA-hosted AI model reads screenshots; its
terms allow logging, so avoid sending images with your own bank or personal details. Details:
